		<p>The Ptidej tool suite (Pattern Trace Identification, Detection, and Enhancement in Java) to evaluate and to enhance the quality of object-oriented programs, promoting the use of patterns, either at the language, design, or architectural-levels, including the DECOR method for the detection and correction of design defect.
		<p>The Ptidej tool suite includes many sub-projects. For examples, it includes several parsers for programming languages as <b>AOL</b>, <b>C++</b>, <b>C#</b>, <b>Java</b> (classfiles, source code, and JAR files).
		<p>The Ptidej tool suite also includes DECOR, a method to specify and generate design and code smells detection algorithms, and its implementation, SAD. With SAD, <b>it is possible to specify as many design and code smells as desired, to generate automatically their detection algorithms, and to apply these algorithms on any program models.</b>  
		<p>Ptidej Blackbox is a user interface part of the Ptidej tool suite that allows building a model of a Java program, from its classfiles only, and to assess the number of design and code smells occurring in this program:
		<ol>
		<li> First, locate and select a directory containing some classfiles:<br>
		<img src="file:doc/1 - Create Model From Java Bytecode.png">
		<br> 
		<img src="file:doc/2 - Select Java Root Path.png"> 
		<br>
		<li> Then, Ptidej Blackbox will build a model of the select classfiles and display some statistics about it:<br>
		<img src="file:doc/3 - Currently Loaded Model.png">
		<br>
		<li> Then, select, for example, a code smell to detect:<br>
		<img src="file:doc/4 - Detect Code Smells.png"> 
		<br>
		<li> Finally, Ptidej Blackbox performs the detection and display its numerical results:<br>

		<br>
		</ol>

		<p>Ptidej has been developed by Yann-Gaël Guéhéneuc and members of the Ptidej Team.
		<p>In particular, the specification language is based on ideas of and has been designed by Naouel Moha.
