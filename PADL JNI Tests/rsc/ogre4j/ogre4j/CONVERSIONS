The following lists the changes between the Ogre3D C++ API and its 
corresponding Java API.


1) Ogre::FrameListener
virtual bool frameStarted (const FrameEvent &evt) has been changed to
bool frameStarted(float timeSinceLastEvent, float timeSinceLastFrame)

virtual bool frameEnded (const FrameEvent &evt) has been changed to
bool frameEnded (float timeSinceLastEvent, float timeSinceLastFrame)

This way, a FrameEvent does not have to be created every frame.

2) Ogre::FrameEvent
This class no longer exists.  See (1).

3) Ogre::NameValuePairList 
This class no longer exists.  Use any class that implements the Java Map 
interface.

4) Ogre::ParameterList
This class no longer exists.  It has been replaced by Vector<ParameterDef>.

5) Ogre::ResourceHandle
This class no longer exists.  Use a int as its replacement.
(previous definition: typedef unsigned long Ogre::ResourceHandle)

6) Ogre::MovablePlane
This class extends MovableObject only, not MovableObject and Plane.  This is
because there is no multiple inheritance in java.

7) Ogre::FogMode 
The constants in this enumeration are placed in Common.

8) Ogre::ParameterType
The constants in this enumeration are placed in ParameterDef.

9) Ogre::SceneManager::SpecialCaseRenderQueueMode 
The constants in this enumeration are placed in SceneManager.

10) Ogre::RenderQueueGroupID 
The constants in this enumeration are placed in RenderQueue.

11) Ogre::Node::TransformSpace 
The constants in this enumeration are placed in Node.

The following classes found in the Ogre3D C++ API are implemented entirely in
Java.
Vector3
Plane
