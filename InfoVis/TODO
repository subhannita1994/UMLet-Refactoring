	Diffentiate internal columns and synthetic columns
		Use metadata / sync with IO to not save them
	Check desallocation of visualizations (listeners prevent it)

Tables

		Overlaying of graph links

Graphs
	Finish searches

Panels
	Other dynamic query components
		Radio buttons
		Check boxes
	Range sliders

		Provide an AbstractWriter
	Manage metadata in Writers/Readers
	Guess column types after loading them as strings to guess right
	When loading XML trees, don't leave the ROOT without attributes

Components
	Color editors for Color Visualizations
	Create sparse columns for loading XML/HTML files.
	
Graphics
	Stroked fonts

Visualization
	Allow several visualizations in a Panel, for rulers, sliders etc.
	Add "rulers" for scales and so.
	
Excentric Labels
	Manage labels near the edges
	Allow selection through labels by freezing them with shift

Fisheyes
