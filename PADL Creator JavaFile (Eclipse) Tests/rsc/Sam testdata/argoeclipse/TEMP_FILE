--------- Original GoF Patterns ----------



Flyweight Pattern.
LRU is a flyweight factory.
IMPORT_SOURCES_FILESYSTEM_PATH is a flyweight object (declared public-static-final).
File location: trunk/argoeclipse/core/src/org/argouml/argoeclipse/internal/core/model/LRU.java

Factory Method pattern.
UniqueSelection is a Factory Method class.
UniqueSelectionImportSetting is a concrete Factory Method class.
getOptions is a factory method returns  ArrayList
 which extends List
