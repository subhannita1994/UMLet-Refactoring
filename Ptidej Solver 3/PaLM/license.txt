PaLM PUBLIC LICENSE
version 1.00, November 2001.

. Preamble The PaLM library was built from the DECorum system: a C++
library used as a demonstration of explanation-based constraint
programming. The PaLM library is powered by CHOCO, an open source
constraint engine developed as the kernel of the OCRE project. The
OCRE project (its name standing for "Outil Contraintes pour la
Recherche et l’Enseignement", i.e., "Constraint tool for Research and
Education") aims at building free Constraint Programming tools that
anyone in the Constraint Programming and Constraint Reasoning
community can use.  For more information see <a
href=http://www.emn.fr/info/contraintes/ocre/public/>www.emn.fr/info/contraintes/ocre/public/</a>
and <a
href=http://www.choco-constraints.net>www.choco-constraints.net</a>.

This license describes the rights of users of PaLM. Its purpose is to ensure that PaLM
serves its original purpose of helping the community of people interested in explanation-
based constraint programming in taking advantage of the methods and tools developed in the 
research community. 
As a PaLM user, this license protects your rights of freely using PaLM in three ways:
(1) This license gives you the right to freely use PaLM for research and education purposes.
(2) This license also gives you the right to freely use PaLM within commercial applications.
(3) PaLM is protected by a copyright. No organization, and no individual beside me 
    (Narendra Jussien) may claim property over PaLM and forbid you from using it.
Thus, you may use PaLM for research, prototyping and, when you reach the point of an 
interesting application, you don’t need to throw your code away and start from scratch; 
you may turn your prototype into an application and do commercial business for it without 
restrictions. 
Last, unlike both GNU general public licenses, in order to encourage the development of 
additional components based on PaLM, it is not required that this license covers 
additional libraries that you would develop based on PaLM: you may write libraries 
(such as libraries of constraints), charge a fee for their use and distribute them in 
object code only (retaining their source code).
With this whole range of possible uses, we hope that everyone interested by the idea 
of a cooperative project for explanation-based constraint programming techniques will 
find a role that enables him both to contribute to and to take advantage of this work. 
In the long run, we hope that this will lead to the development of a wide set of free 
components using PaLM.

. Terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
0. This License applies to the PaLM library: its source Claire files and all material 
distributed therewith (documentation, code samples and test programs) or other work which 
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the 
terms of this PaLM Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or 
work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work 
under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, 
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) 
Each licensee is addressed as "you". 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this 
License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted. 

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you 
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish 
on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact 
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; 
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus 
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or 
work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these 
conditions : 
·	a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that 
           you changed the files and the date of any change. 
·	b) If your contributions are not grouped into an independent package 
           (such as an additional library), but form a mere modification of the Program, 
           you may distribute a modified version of the Program, but you are required to 
           send your modifications either to <a href=http://www.e-constraints.net>www.e-constraints.net</a> or <a href=http://forums.e-constraints.net>forums.e-constraints.net</a>.
           Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights 
           to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to 
           control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. 
           Indeed, we want to centralize all bugs fixes, patches and simple extensions so 
           that only one robust version of the program gets distributed under this license 
           rather than many different ones. 
·	c) If your contributions are not grouped into an independent package, you must 
           acknowledge the use of the Program by reproducing the following statement 
           along with all communications about your contributions:
            "This software is powered by PaLM, an open source explanation-based constraint 
  	    engine. For more information see <a href=http://www.e-constraints.net>www.e-constraints.net</a>."

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) 
in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided 
that you also give access to the source code of the Program, by doing one of the following: 
·	a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, 
           which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a 
           medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
·	b) Accompany it with the information that the source code is available from
           the web site <a href=http://www.e-constraints.net>www.e-constraints.net</a>. 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications 
to it. So, it means, both the Claire source code for PaLM and a compatible version of 
the Claire system, able to compile PaLM.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
designated place, then, offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same 
place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not 
compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 

4. In case you distribute the Program along with additional libraries that you have built, 
you may neither claim the property of the Program, nor file patents on the Program. 
Property and patent rights may be claimed by you only on your components whose source can 
be separated into different files that can be compiled apart from the rest of the Program; 
you may not claim it on small modifications that you make within the source code of 
the Program, nor on the original source code from the Program that you did not write.

5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly 
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or 
distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under 
this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under 
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain 
in full compliance. 

6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program 
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept 
this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based 
on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms 
and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 

. NO WARRANTY
1. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, 
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE 
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY 
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES 
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY 
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME 
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
2. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY 
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM 
AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM 
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES. 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
