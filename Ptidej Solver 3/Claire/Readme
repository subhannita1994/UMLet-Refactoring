Installing CLAIRE takes 2 -or 3- (easy ?) steps:
===============================================

(1) unzip the release.zip file (under UNIX use -Ua options, cf. notes (b) and (c))
    you must have done this to read this README :-)
     
    rename the release directory into something meaningfull like 
    clairev3.2
    This directory will become the "home directory" for the installation

    for instance the home may be d:/clairev3.2. In the following, we
    call it "clhome".
    the environment variable CLAIRE3_HOME must be set to this clhome
    directory


(2a) If you are optimistic, you simply type
       nmake -f Makefile.nt        // nt
       make -f Makefile.unix       // unix
     This should do what is described in the rest of the README :-)

     The automated makefile has been tune for nt & linux.
     If a problem occurs, you can go step by step as follows ...


(2b) .. first, you need to create a first executable named "sclaire"
     using the included makefile:
    make sclaire : (*)
      - will create the different libraries for the CLAIRE modules
      - will generate sclaire  (*)

    Note:  There are two included makefiles: Makefile.nt for NT and 
    Makefile.unix for UNIX. They may require some customization for
    your own OS but it should be straightforward.
    the ROOT variable in the makefile may need to be set manually ...
    (*) the target is sclaire under UNIX and sclaire.exe under NT

(3) then, you will create your personalized version of claire by running
       make cclaire.
    This step re-compiles the included ccmain.cl file and re-generate a 
    claire system.
    The proper initialization of the CLAIRE system directory is done in 
    the init.cl file. You may edit and customize this file if you wish a 
    different directory organization
    
    You may included additional modules in your final claire system
    (when available)
    You may tune the generation of makefile for the CLAIRE compiler 
    since the code is found in the ccmain.cl file
 
    If you wish to modify ccmain.cl significantly, you may need to 
    compile it manually.
    This is explained in the last paragraph of the init.cl file.


Notes
-----

(a) the /bin organization is
       debug: subdirectory for debug version of libs
       public: subdirectory for regular (optimized)

    debug and public can have as many subdirectories as
    OS/environments that you want to support.


(b) Unix is case-sensitive and Windows NT is not. Therefore, one may
    need to rename some of the files. Your unzip utility probably has an
    option to ensure that Uppercase file names are preserved (e.g. -u or -U)

(c) If you need to translate DOS files (13+10) into regular files, the 
    dos2f C program is included for your convenience.
    Note that the -a option of unzip should also solve this problem.


(d) The default UNIX OS that is used to qualify this installation package is
    LINUX (Red Hat). The header file marie.h contains statements that are
    not portable on all UNIX systems and that may require some manual tuning:
        [1]  #include <time.h> is not as standard as it should
        [2]  The CLFLPAR flag is set by default if CLUNIX is chosen. This is
             appropriate for LINUX but not for other OS. This tells CLAIRE that
             the C++ compiler is able to allocate float slots in an object anywhere
             witout parity constraints (not true for NT).
