* JCT README

** Dependence

You need a few utilities in order to generate the documentation, the version are
informative only, it should works with any later version and probably some
earlier also:
 - Apache Ant: http://ant.apache.org/ [1.7.1]
 - Javadoc: http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/ [the one included with the Sun JDK
1.6.0.12] (usualy included within all JDK distribution)
 - UML Graph: http://www.umlgraph.org/ [5.2]

Download and install each of them.

** Fetching the source code

This file intends to provide an access to the JCT documentation.

JCT is composed of 4 Eclipse projects:
 - JCT-Utils
 - JCT
 - JCT-Impl
 - JCT-Tools

You should first download them from the Ptidej SVN, with the names:
 - JCT Utils
 - JCT
 - JCT Impl
 - JCT Tools

** Updating the configuration to reflect local filesystem

In the JCT Project, you will find a directory named "rsc", in which there is
this README file, another directory named "doc" and some other miscellaneous
files dans directories.

Open the file named rsc/doc/build.xml, on lines 34 to 40, you will find the
following tags:

<example>
<property name="root_dir" value="/home/swoog/docs/boulot/UdeM/Maitrise"/>
<property name="util_dir" value="${root_dir}/JCT-Utils"/>
<property name="interface_dir" value="${root_dir}/JCT"/>
<property name="impl_dir" value="${root_dir}/JCT-Impl"/>
<property name="tools_dir" value="${root_dir}/JCT-Tools"/>
<property name="doc_dir" value="${interface_dir}/doc"/>
<property name="umlgraph_jar" value="/usr/share/UMLGraph/lib/UmlGraph.jar"/>
</example>

The first line (root_dir) should contains the path to the directory in which you
checked out the project from the SVN.

The four following lines (util_dir, interface_dir, impl_dir, tools_dir) should
contains the name of the directories in which you checked out each project.

The sixth line (doc_dir) should contains the path to the directory in which you
want the documentation to be stored.

The last list (umlgraph_jar) should contains the path to the UMLGraph jar you
generated to install UMLGraph.

** Generate and browse the documentation

Once each variable has been set to an adequate value, spawn a new shell in the 
rsc/doc directory and simply run ant (ant and javadoc need to be in your PATH).

The documentation will be generated, There are five entry points to the Javadoc:
 - ${doc_dir}/util/index.html
 - ${doc_dir}/jct/util/index.html
 - ${doc_dir}/jct/kernel/index.html
 - ${doc_dir}/jct/impl/index.html
 - ${doc_dir}/jct/tools/index.html

The two main entry points being jct/kernel and jct/impl.

** Online version

There is an online version which may not be up-to-date, you are strongly
encourage to generate your own version of the JavaDoc from the source code:
